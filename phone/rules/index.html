                        <p>You are not allowed to seek out and/or kill anyone involved with your character's death. When you are killed, your character loses all memory leading up to and including their death unless they were rescued by paramedics. This may involve no longer knowing or recognizing your killer(s) after dying. You must also do your absolute best to avoid the player(s) who killed you, and definitely not kill them, provoke them, or otherwise engage them in any role play situation. If you are killed by a player, or a group of players, or the police you will forget everything involving your character and the opposing character(s) in that situation. If you are killed in an area that is not crucial to your character (house, or job), you should avoid the area to make a better roleplay for a while. This all also applies to any death even accidental.</p>

The situation must be role-played out between both parties. If your vehicle does not possess a license plate due to game mechanics, you may not roleplay that it has one anyway. Any vehicle purchased from the dealership that does not have a visible plate will be considered registered as a recreational vehicle.

If someone has already committed a crime and the roleplay is taken to such an area, it may be acceptable. This means don't rob somebody standing in front of the bank, police station or hospital. Attempt to kidnap somebody in front or inside of a heavily populated area. Crimes committed outside of a safe zone with the sole intention of leading it into one will not be tolerated. We will allow crimes to continue if relocation into the safe zone itself is unavoidable, but attempts to abuse this will be met with swift punishment. Do not kidnap a player, subsequently leading them to Del Perro Pier to drop them off the edge. Don't kidnap a player and lead them to the airport to steal their plane. Do not kidnap a police officer to then demand they to release your car from the impound lot and etc.</p>
